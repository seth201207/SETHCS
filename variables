#1. Take the sentence: All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. Store each word in a separate variable, then print out the sentence on one line using print.

a = "All "
b = "work "
c = "and "
d = "no "
e = "play "
f = "makes "
g = "Jack "
h = "a "
i = "dull "
j = "boy."

print(a+b+c+d+e+f+g+h+i+j)

#2. Add parenthesis to the expression 6 * 1 - 2 to change its value from 4 to -6.

print(6*(1-2))

#3.Place a comment before a line of code that previously worked, and record what happens when you rerun the program.

#Nothing happens because comments that are preceeded by a hashtag are not interpreted but if you were to write this without the hashtag, the code would not run and it would cause an error.

#4. Start the Python interpreter and enter bruce + 4 at the prompt. This will give you an error:

bruce = 6
print(bruce + 4)

#5. Write a Python program that assigns the principal amount of $10000 to variable P, assign to n the value 12, and assign to r the interest rate of 8%. Then have the program prompt the user for the number of years t that the money will be compounded for. Calculate and print the final amount after t years.

P = 10000
n = 12
r = 8

t = int(input("Please insert the number of years.\n   > "))
A = P*(1+(r/n))**(n*t)
print("$"+str(A))

#6. Evaluate the following numerical expressions in your head, then use the Python interpreter to check your results:

#1, 4, 3, 12, 0, 0, Error

print(str(5%2)+", "+str(9%5)+", "+str(15%12)+", "+str(12%15)+", "+str(6%6)+", "+str(0%7))
#The last one has been ommited because it caused an error

#7. You look at the clock and it is exactly 2pm. You set an alarm to go off in 51 hours. At what time does the alarm go off? (Hint: you could count on your fingers, but this is not what weâ€™re after. If you are tempted to count on your fingers, change the 51 to 5100.)

#5pm

#8. Write a Python program to solve the general version of the above problem. Ask the user for the time now (in hours), and ask for the number of hours to wait. Your program should output what the time will be on the clock when the alarm goes off.

time_now = int(input("Please insert the time now in hours according to a 24 hour clock.\n   > "))
time_wait = int(input("How many hours should the alarm wait.\n   > "))

time_alarm = (time_now+time_wait)%24
print("The alarm will go off at " + str(time_alarm)+" o clock.")
